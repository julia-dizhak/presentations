        <h2>slide 1: yarn (an npm alternative)</h2>
        <p>Hi guys, today, I’m going to talk to you about new package manager for Js.
            The product is called Yarn - a fast, reliable and secure alternative (for) npm client.</p>

        <h2>slide 2: yarn build by facebook</h2>
        <p>
            The package manager developed (and used) by Facebook, in collaboration with Google, Exponent, and Tilde.
            Yarn provides a number of benefits (which I fully cover later) including
            auto generation of lock files,
            quicker package downloads,
            the ability to download packages offline.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Js community, engineers share hundreds of thousands of pieces of code so we can avoid rewriting basic
            components, libraries, or frameworks of our own. Each piece of code may in turn depend on other piece of
            code, and these dependencies are managed by package managers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most popular Js package manager is the npm client, which provides access (found statistics on January
            2017) to more than 350,000 packages. In fact, it is the largest package registry in the world. More than 5
            million engineers use the npm registry, which sees up to 5 billion downloads every month. Every week roughly
            160 people publish their first package in the registry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yarn package manager uses and saves compatible with npm registry and have separate one. You can go on the
            official website https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages and search for packages you would like to install (So far I
            didn’t have problem, to be honest).
        </p>
        <p>
            So what does it mean?
            <br>
            It means that you can start using yarn very easily with existing projects. Because it puts dependencies in
            node_modules, just like npm, so all your tooling should work the same. If you already have yarn installed,
            for installing dependencies using yarn you can type from console “yarn" or “yarn install"
            It’s reads from the package.json file, so it should work on any project that’s already using npm.
        </p>

        <h2>slide 3: Yarn > NPM (what was the problems with a NPM?)</h2>
        <p>
            NPM is amazing, is awesome tool but has a problems.
            Community used the npm client successfully for years, but as the size of codebase and the number of
            engineers grew, npm ran into problems with consistency, security and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default NPM is not 100% deterministic. What does it mean? You can't guarantee that the same dependencies
            will be installed the same exact way across every machine in your team.
            Even if you use npm-shrinkwrap (which is lock dependencies file) you can’t guaranteed to produce the same
            output on another computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second problem, the amount of time which needs take to pull dependencies in.
        </p>
        <p>
            And some security concerns (problems) with the way the npm client executes code from some of dependencies
            automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually what I want to add, that since yarn was realized, the npm start to fix their problem. So as far you
            have competitors ...

            (March 2016. How one developer just broke Node, Babel and thousands of projects in 11 lines of Js.
            https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)

            (first the scaling npm then own product)
            You can fix this by using Yarn.
